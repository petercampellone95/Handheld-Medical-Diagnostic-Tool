# Handheld-Medical-Diagnostic-Tool
The Handheld Medical Diagnostic Tool or HMDT for short was a device created as the final project for a class on microprocessors. The goal of the HMDT was to create a simple handheld device capable of taking temperature measurements and reading the beats-per-minute (bpm) of a human heart in a small battery-powered form factor capable of lasting a full 8-hour day. The case was 3D printed using my own personal 3D printer and took about 7-8 design revisions for both the top and bottom cases. You can find some of the 3D model design files (.stl) in this repository to get an idea of the progression made through each of the revisions. 

Some of the features of the HMDT are as follows:

-2000mAh LiPo Battery
-USB Charging
-Simple 16x2 Character LCD for measurement readout with tactile switch controlled menu-system 
-ATMEGA 328P 8-Bit AVR microcontroller
-MLX90614 IR Temperature Sensor (Front-Mounted)
-Clip-on IR Pulse Sensor
-Battery life readout and low battery warning message
-Ergonomic 3D printed case with similar dimensions to modern smartphones
